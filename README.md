# POVStick
This is a Persistance Of Vision display in form of a NeoPixel stick. In the future this will be a much shorter and denser handheld LED strip. A SLR will be used in long time exposure mode to "stitch" the image back together as the stick is moved across its field of vision.

The image is stored on a SD card and read by an AVR. The display itself is a string of WS2812 Pixel LEDs. At this (unoptimized) state the AVR is capable of displaying around 75 lines per second at 288 LEDs per line.
